Celery is a great tool for asynchronously firing off an email from your web
application. But what happens when your application grows beyond simple "set it
and forget it" tasks? This talk explores the workflow primitives Celery provides
and how to effectively use them to create complex distributed applications. It
assumes working knowledge of Python and Celery. By the end, you will have a
better understanding of how to structure significant distributed work in a way
that is both scalable and resistent to failure.
